We have a new project website (http://sourceforge.net/projects/olyo/) on sourceforge now.

Olyo is an open source project dedicated to implementing P2P SIP based elements such as P2P SIP proxy, P2P SIP adaptor, UA and etc.. Currently a p2psip lib, along with a modified Partysip and a modified Linphone using the lib, is available. The modified Partysip can run as both P2PSIP proxy mode and P2PSIP adaptor mode. This project is promoted by Mobile Life Lab of Beijing Univ. of Posts and Telecoms (BUPT) and is still in its early stage. To learn more about olyo, please take a look at our wiki. Contact us if there are any questions, or if you want to join the olyo project.
