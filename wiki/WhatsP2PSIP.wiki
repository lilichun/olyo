#summary What's P2P SIP?

= Introduction =

combination of SIP and P2P


= Details =

Session Initial Protocol (SIP) is an application layer control protocol which enables establishing, modifying and terminating multimedia sessions. The traditional SIP is a centralized approach, which leads to high deployment cost and low robustness. On the other hand, peer-to-peer systems operate resources such as user’s location in a distributed manner without the deployment of central servers. Therefore, it is proposed to integrate SIP and P2P together. Many benefits can be gained from the combination. From the SIP’s point of view, central servers such as SIP proxies and registrars can be removed to reduce the deployment and maintenance cost, also, the robustness of SIP increases via the scalable and reliable P2P approach. From the P2P’s point of view, the introducing of SIP will make the overlay controllable and specific applications such as Peer-to-Peer Internet Phone and Instant Message can be easily implemented.
