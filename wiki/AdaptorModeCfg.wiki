#summary Configuration Guide for Adator Mode

==Objectives==
This guide describes the steps and commands necessary to configure and run Partysip in an Adaptor Mode. Corresponding reference information and examples are provided as well.

== Audience ==
This documentation is intended for users who want to run a SIP UA over 
Bamboo DHT, but are not necessarily familier with configuration of Bamboo
and Partysip. In addition, some familiarity with P2PSIP, especially the
architecture of Adaptor Mode is required.

== Configuration Instructions ==
*Here is a task list to configure and run Partysip in an Adaptor Mode:*
 # Configure Bamboo: edit arguments in Bamboo configurtion file used to join each node into the overlay.
 # Configure Partysip: edit arguments in Partysip configuration file used for communication with Bamboo.
 # Create a overlay: start Bamboo on each node and create a P2P overlay.
 # Start Adaptor: start Partysip and connect a SIP UA with it. Partysip is considered as an adaptor for the SIP UA to run over P2P network.

Much more details are available in [http://olyo.googlecode.com/files/adptorcfgguide0204.pdf adptorcfgguide0204.pdf].
